        Welcome to the portfolio of Justin Bedford! To start off with, I am a recent graduate
                from the University of Central Florida. In my studies there, I obtained a Bachelor of
                Science degree in a major of Health Sciences Pre-clinical. After over 8 years of 
                working in healthcare I have made a life choice to switch things up. Come checkout my
                work as I embark on the never-ending journey of learning web development!
